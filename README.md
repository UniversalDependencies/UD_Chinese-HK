# Summary

A Traditional Chinese treebank of film subtitles and of legislative proceedings
of Hong Kong, parallel with the Cantonese-HK treebank.

# Introduction

The Chinese-HK UD treebank was manually annotated by Herman H. M. Leung and Tak-sum Wong at City University of Hong Kong, directly using the subtitles from three films shot by students from the School of Creative Media as well as part of the official record of proceedings of the section of the Election of President of the council meeting of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR of the P. R. China on 12th October, 2016 commencing at 2:13 p.m. The data are in Traditional Chinese. These trees form a parallel treebank with those in Cantonese-HK.

DATA

Since there are fewer than a myriad tokens, only the test set is provided.

BASIC STATISTICS

* Tree count:  1004
* Word count:  9874
* Token count: 9874
* Dep. relations: 46 of which 15 language specific
* POS tags: 16
* Category=value feature pairs: 1

POS TAGGING

When determining the POS, one usually considers both the "morphological evidence", i.e., the linguistic form of the word, as well as the "distributional evidence", i.e., its syntactic use in the sentence. Usually, these two kinds of evidence should agree; in some cases, however, the POS of some word is tentatively alterned to fullfil the special purpose of the author.

Take an example in English, consider the word "pen" in the sentence "I pen a letter".  Morphological evidence suggests the word "pen" should be tagged as an noun (NN), reflecting its normal usage. Distributional evidence suggests it should be tagged as a verb, since this word is in a typical syntactic position of verb in a SVO language.

When these two kinds of evidence contradict one another, the morphological evidence prevails.
